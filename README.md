As my father would always say, "Many hours of studies and practice, achievement is practically a given". Rodelo Bot is a pomodoro discord bot to facilitate good study habits by allowing users to use the pomodoro method. By encouraging people to focus well, Rodelobot seeks to transform discord studying servers into a convenient, simple, empowering experience.

## Background
When my university fall term started, I realized that people were using discord as a medium to host study groups and study sessions. The first day in every Zoom class included students posting their discord links asking people to join their study group.

Studying can be kind of a pain. With dozens of distractions on the computer, I tend to be unproductive and unwilling to study. Through this project, I sought to explore how I could empower students throught these disconnected times and transform the discord studying experience to be **simple and fun**. I wanted to making studying **convenient and empowering**.

## Challenge and High Level Goals
People are less willing to study and be productive when distracted by apps on the computer.

**How might we reimagine the discord space to build good study habits**
- Discord study groups can be unproductive. It's easy to get distracted when a computer with dozens of apps are at my disposal. Making studying feel like a tangible accomplishment, will help me be motivated to study.


## How it works

**The owner of the server must create a "studying" role**
- !pomodoro [x]  specify the time in minutes that you would like to study for
When the pomodoro starts, you'll be assigned "studying" role. Owners can customize the role how they'd like - just don't give it managing/admin permissions. When the pomodoro ends, you'll be removed from the "studying" role.



## Rodelo Dimaano
This app is a tribute to my father. He passed away on May 11, 2020 because of covid complications. The last time I was able to talk to him was when he was sitting at the dining table eating his birthday lunch - boiling point hot pot. Even then, it was so brief. I never got to say goodbye to my father, the last thing I said to him in person was "Happy Birthday!". I still listen to the leftover voicemails because that's the closest thing I'll get to hearing his voice again. His last words to me were "study hard". I actually did not even hear him say these words - he was too weak to say it loudly through iPhone speakers - my mom told me that he said this to me. I never got to hear these last words but they're really profound - simple but profound. Throughout my life, my dad was my greatest supporter - always cheering me up when I got straight As on my report card. He was happier than i was when I graduated. He really was the proudest father. The message that the bot sends when a study session is over is something my dad said when I graduated. If he were alive in 2023, he'd probably say that again. Everyday, I am constantly reminded that I am here because of my dad and he really wanted me to succeed. So I will. I just want to make my dad proud again :).
